# Bonita Baddies Wellness Intelligence System 💅🧠✨

**Submitted for the Encode Commit to Change AI Hackathon**

An AI-powered holistic wellness coach optimizing Time, Space, and Self using the Gemini API.

---

## 🚧 Road to Perfection (To-Do List)

This is an MVP built for the hackathon. The vision for the future includes:

- [ ] **RAG Integration**: Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation to query a massive database of neuroscience papers, ancient texts, and clinical protocols dynamically.
- [ ] **LLM Evaluation (Opik)**: Integrate Opik for rigorous tracking and evaluation of prompt conversations to ensure clinical safety and tonal consistency.
- [ ] **Agentic AI**: Build autonomous agents to retrieve real-time biometric data from wearable APIs:
    - Strava (Activity)
    - WHOOP (Recovery)
    - Oura (Sleep)
    - Garmin (HRV)
    - Eight Sleep (Thermoregulation)

## ❓ Why Build This?

### What is being "Bonita"?
"Bonita" (Beautiful) shares roots with the Latin *Bonus* (Good). True wellness is the convergence of the **Beautiful** (aesthetic, form, expression) and the **Good** (function, virtue, health). It is the state where your biology supports your psychology, and your environment reflects your internal clarity.

### The Mission
This project was built for the **Encode Commit to Change AI Hackathon**, but the roots are deeply personal.

1.  **Wedding Prep**: I am personally looking to establish "bonita" routines with my fiancée in this new year leading up to our wedding. We wanted a system that didn't just nag us, but educated us on the *why* behind our habits.
2.  **Practice Intuition**: This tool is a digital extension of my founding company, **Practice Intuition**, a think tank and consulting service dedicated to optimizing human performance and systems.

## 🧠 Core Frameworks

### The Triage Pillars
The system triages user needs into three fundamental dimensions of existence:
*   **TIME**: Chronobiology, circadian rhythm alignment, and ultradian cycles. *Are you fighting your biological clock?*
*   **SPACE**: Physical health, fascial integrity, and environmental design. *Is your vessel and environment supporting you?*
*   **SELF**: Identity, emotional processing, and cognitive load. *Is your internal software calibrated?*

### The Assessment Trinity (IQ/EQ/KQ)
Unlike traditional wellness apps that track only steps or calories, we track the three intelligences:
*   **IQ (Intellectual Quotient)**: Focus duration, mental clarity, and executive function.
*   **EQ (Emotional Quotient)**: Emotional regulation, relationship quality, and stress resilience.
*   **KQ (Kinesthetic Quotient)**: Interoception (internal body sense), proprioception (movement sense), and physical intuition.
