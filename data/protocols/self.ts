# SELF Pillar - IQ/EQ/KQ Assessment & Integration Protocols

## Core Principle
Human intelligence is multidimensional. Intellectual Quotient (IQ), Emotional Quotient (EQ), and Kinesthetic Quotient (KQ) form an integrated system. Optimizing one pillar enhances others; neglecting one degrades overall wellbeing.

## IQ - INTELLECTUAL QUOTIENT PROTOCOLS

### Protocol SELF-1: Daily Cognitive Assessment
**Goal**: Track cognitive performance patterns to optimize work timing  
**Duration**: 2 minutes (end of day)  
**Timing**: Evening reflection

**Assessment Questions**:
1. **Focus Duration**: How many hours of deep focus did you achieve today?
   - 0-2hrs / 2-4hrs / 4-6hrs / 6+hrs

2. **Mental Clarity**: Rate 1-10
   - 1-3: Brain fog, constant distraction
   - 4-7: Functional but effortful
   - 8-10: Crystal clear, effortless concentration

3. **Cognitive Load**: Did any tasks feel overwhelming today?
   - Yes (specify task) / No / Manageable with effort

4. **Time Management**: Did you work on highest-priority tasks during peak hours?
   - Yes (when?) / No (what blocked you?) / Didn't know peak hours

5. **Learning**: Did you acquire new knowledge or skills today?
   - Yes (what?) / No / Reviewed existing knowledge

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Track for 7-14 days
- Identify: Peak focus times, cognitive dip patterns, task-timing mismatches
- Correlate with: Sleep quality, meal timing, exercise, stress levels

**Science**:
- Cognitive performance follows circadian rhythm (peaks 2-4hrs post-wake typically)
- Metacognitive awareness improves self-regulation
- Working memory capacity varies with fatigue, stress, nutrition
- Reference: Chronotype research, executive function studies

**Success Metric**: Identify personal cognitive rhythm, schedule alignment

---

### Protocol SELF-2: Pomodoro Variation (Focus Block Structure)
**Goal**: Maintain sustained focus while respecting cognitive limits  
**Duration**: 90-minute work blocks  
**Timing**: During identified peak cognitive hours  
**Frequency**: 2-4 blocks per day maximum

**Technique**:
1. **Pre-Block** (5min):
   - Clear workspace
   - Eliminate distractions (phone away, close email)
   - Define specific task/outcome for block

2. **Work Block** (90min):
   - Single task focus (no task-switching)
   - If distraction arises: Note it, return to task
   - Track focus "breaks" (how many times attention wanders)

3. **Break** (10-20min):
   - Physical movement (walk, stretch)
   - Different mental modality (social, creative, nature)
   - Avoid screens if possible

4. **Repeat**: Maximum 4 blocks per day (6hrs deep work)

**Adaptation for ADHD/Attention Challenges**:
- Start with 25min blocks (original Pomodoro)
- Gradually extend: 25 → 45 → 60 → 90min
- External accountability (body-doubling, timer apps)

**Science**:
- Ultradian rhythm = ~90min cycles (BRAC - basic rest-activity cycle)
- Task-switching = cognitive residue (Sophie Leroy research)
- Breaks essential for memory consolidation
- Reference: Cirillo Pomodoro Technique, Ericsson deliberate practice

**Success Metric**: Complete 2-4 focused blocks daily, reduced task-switching

---

### Protocol SELF-3: Learning Consolidation Routine
**Goal**: Enhance memory formation and skill acquisition  
**Duration**: 10-20 minutes  
**Timing**: Evening (before bed) or immediately post-learning  
**Frequency**: Daily

**Techniques**:

**Option A: Active Recall**
- Review day's learnings WITHOUT looking at notes
- Speak aloud or write down what you remember
- Check accuracy, note gaps
- Re-review gaps next day

**Option B: Teach-Back Method**
- Explain concept to someone (or imaginary audience)
- Use simple language (Feynman Technique)
- Identify where explanation breaks down = incomplete understanding

**Option C: Spaced Repetition**
- Review new information: Same day, next day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month
- Use flashcards (Anki software) for efficient scheduling
- Focus on material you get wrong

**Science**:
- Testing effect: Retrieval practice strengthens memory more than re-reading
- Spacing effect: Distributed practice > massed practice
- Sleep consolidation: Memory transfer from hippocampus to cortex during sleep
- Reference: Bjork research, cognitive psychology of learning

**Success Metric**: Improved long-term retention, faster skill acquisition

## EQ - EMOTIONAL QUOTIENT PROTOCOLS

### Protocol SELF-4: Daily Emotional Check-In
**Goal**: Develop emotional awareness and identify patterns  
**Duration**: 3 minutes  
**Timing**: Morning + Evening  
**Frequency**: Daily

**Morning Assessment**:
1. **Mood Quality**: How do you feel waking up? (1-10)
   - What emotion is most present? (joy, anxiety, neutral, sadness, excitement)

2. **Emotional Energy**: Rate capacity to engage emotionally today (1-10)
   - Low = withdrawn, protective
   - High = open, responsive, expressive

3. **Anticipated Challenges**: Any emotionally difficult situations today?
   - How do you want to show up?

**Evening Reflection**:
1. **Mood Trajectory**: How did mood shift throughout day?
   - Morning → Afternoon → Evening rating

2. **Emotional Regulation**: Did you manage emotions effectively?
   - Overreacted / Underreacted / Balanced response
   - Example situation?

3. **Connection**: Did you feel emotionally connected to others?
   - Isolated / Superficial / Meaningful connection

4. **Expression**: Did you express yourself authentically today?
   - Suppressed / Partial / Fully expressed

**Pattern Tracking**:
- Correlate with: Sleep, exercise, social interaction, stress events
- Identify: Emotional triggers, regulation strategies that work, connection needs

**Science**:
- Emotional granularity (specific labeling) improves regulation
- Interoception (body awareness) predicts emotional intelligence
- Metacognitive awareness of emotions reduces rumination
- Reference: Lisa Feldman Barrett emotion research, Goleman EQ framework

**Success Metric**: Increased emotional awareness, proactive regulation

**For Sadness/Depression**:
- **Opposite Action** (DBT): Do opposite of urge (go out vs. isolate)
- **Behavioral Activation**: Small achievable task (make bed, shower)
- **Social Connection**: Text/call one person

**For Emotional Numbness**:
- **Sensory Stimulation**: Cold water on face, ice cube in hand
- **Movement**: Dance, shake body

### Protocol SELF-6: Gratitude & Positive Emotion Cultivation
**Goal**: Shift baseline emotional state toward positive affect  
**Duration**: 5 minutes  
**Timing**: Evening (pre-bed) or morning  
**Frequency**: Daily

**Technique**:
1. **Three Good Things**: Write down 3 specific positive events from today
   - Why did this happen? (attribution)
   - How did it make you feel?

2. **Anticipatory Savoring**: Identify 1 thing to look forward to tomorrow
   - Visualize it briefly

**Optional Additions**:
- **Gratitude Letter**: Write to someone (don't have to send)
- **Gratitude Visit**: Read letter in person (powerful intervention)

**Science**:
- Gratitude practice → increased positive affect, life satisfaction
- Shifts attention bias (notice positive over negative)
- Neural plasticity: Strengthens positive emotion circuits with repetition
- Seligman's "Three Blessings" intervention: Significant depression reduction
- Reference: Seligman positive psychology, gratitude research (Emmons)

**Success Metric**: Improved baseline mood, increased life satisfaction

3. **Pain Changes**: Did pain improve, worsen, or stay same?

4. **Recovery Needs**: What does your body need tonight?
   - Stretch / Massage / Rest / Nothing

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Correlate KQ with IQ and EQ (how does body state affect mind and emotions?)
- Identify: Movement patterns, pain triggers, recovery needs

**Science**:
- Interoception = 8th sense (Craig research)
- Poor interoception correlates with anxiety, depression, chronic pain
- Body awareness improves emotional regulation
- Reference: Bud Craig interoceptive awareness, Antonio Damasio somatic markers

**Success Metric**: Accurate body state perception, proactive pain management

---

### Protocol SELF-8: Proprioceptive Training

- Progress: Tandem stance (heel-toe), single-leg squat

**Level 2: Unstable Surface**
- Balance on pillow/foam pad
- Single-leg: 30sec each
- Add movement: Reach arms, head turns

**Level 3: Dynamic Proprioception**
- Controlled articular rotations (CARs): Move joints through full ROM slowly
- Focus: Endpoint control, smooth movement
- Key joints: Shoulders, hips, ankles

**Science**:
- Proprioceptors (muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs) provide position sense
- Declining with age → fall risk increase
- Training improves joint stability, movement quality
- Reference: Exercise science, fall prevention research

---

### Protocol SELF-9: Pain Journaling & Pattern Detection
**Goal**: Understand pain mechanisms through systematic tracking  
**Duration**: 3-5 minutes  
**Timing**: When pain present or daily if chronic  
**Frequency**: As needed or daily

**Tracking Elements**:
1. **Location**: Specific body area (use body map)
2. **Quality**: Sharp, dull, burning, aching, throbbing
3. **Intensity**: 1-10 scale
4. **Timing**: When did it start? Duration? Constant or intermittent?
5. **Aggravating Factors**: What makes it worse?
6. **Relieving Factors**: What helps?
7. **Associated Symptoms**: Numbness, weakness, tingling?
8. **Context**: What were you doing before onset?

**Pattern Analysis** (weekly review):
- Is pain positional (worse with certain postures)?
- Time-related (worse morning vs. evening)?
- Activity-related (after sitting, exercise, stress)?
- Cyclical (hormonal, weather, stress cycles)?

**Science**:
- Chronic pain ≠ tissue damage (pain is output of brain, not input from body)
- Central sensitization: Nervous system amplification
- Pattern detection reveals triggers (mechanical, chemical, emotional)
- Reference: Lorimer Moseley pain neuroscience, Explain Pain

**Red Flags Requiring Medical Evaluation**:
- Sudden severe pain
- Pain with fever, weight loss, night sweats
- Progressive weakness or numbness
- Loss of bowel/bladder control

**Success Metric**: Identify pain patterns, effective management strategies

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes  
**Timing**: Sunday evening or Monday morning  
**Frequency**: Weekly

**Review Process**:

**Step 1: Data Collection**
- Review daily IQ, EQ, KQ assessments from past week
- Note highs and lows in each domain

**Step 2: Pattern Recognition**
- **IQ-EQ Connections**:
  - Did poor sleep affect both mood and focus?
  - Did stress impact cognitive performance?
  
- **EQ-KQ Connections**:
  - Did anxiety manifest as body tension?
  - Did exercise improve mood?
  
- **KQ-IQ Connections**:
  - Did movement breaks improve focus?

- What one change would improve all three domains?

**Step 4: Protocol Adjustment**
- Continue working protocols or pivot?
- Add new protocol based on identified pattern?
- Simplify if overwhelmed?

**Science**:
- Systems thinking: Parts interact in non-linear ways
- Metacognitive reflection improves self-regulation
- Weekly review optimal for pattern detection (daily too granular, monthly too distant)
- Reference: Systems theory, habit formation research

**Success Metric**: Clear correlations identified, targeted interventions
